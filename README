This is a readme for the Michigan Embedded Vision Benchmark (MEVBench).

What is MEVBench?

It is a set of benchmarks that are targeted towards embedded computer vision.


Platforms Tested On:
	Ubuntu 10.04 + on x86 and ARM A9


Required libraries:

OpenCV 2.2 *^
Pthreads




* Note that it may run with OpenCV2.3 also but has not been tested.  
^If using on ARM you will need to enable SIFT by modifying the sift.cpp in the OpenCV source and then building with CMAKE.  You need to comment out the lines that disable SIFT when ARM is detected.



This package includes:


	Feature Extraction:

		SIFT               (N* Threads)
		SURF               (N Theads)
		FAST with Brief    (N Threads)
		HoG                (N Threads)


	Feature Classification:

		SVM                 (N THreads)
		K-nearest neighbor  (N threads)
		Adaboost            (N Threads)


	Application Examples:

		Object Localization (Feature extraction and classification) (N Threads)
		Augmented Reality                                           (1 Thread)
		Face Detection                                              (1 Thread)

*The base build MEVBench structure only has config files for 1,2,4 or 8 threads.  In order to use a different number of threads, a new config file needs to be made.

Building MEVBench:

Build OpenCV 2.2:
	Download OpenCV 2.2 and use cmake to build (Directions can be found at opencv.willowgarage.com)
		If you plan on doing static builds or runs please build a separate static set of OpenCV Libraries
Setup Required Variables:
	Define OpenCV_DIR as the OpenCV Dynamically Linked Install Directory
		export OpenCV_DIR=~/Documents/<OpenCV2.2InstallBase>		

	Define OpenCV_STATIC_DIR as the OpenCV Statically Linked Install Directory
		export OpenCV_DIR=~/Documents/<OpenCV2.2StaticInstallBase



Build the Benchmark:
	In the MEVBench Root:
		./build.sh static
		  or
		./build.sh dynamic

	For more information run build.sh with no parameters

Run the Benchmark:
	In the MEVBench Root:
   		./run.sh all
                 or ./run.sh for a list of options.



Next Update Will Include:
	Automatic Checker For results.

How to check results:
	
	First let me say I am aware of the need to check results.  The result checking was not automated because of time constraints.  Instead for each algorithm I would compare the single threaded result with any multithreaded.
	I would determine if it was reasonable and if they matched well.  This can be done visually by turning the windows on for single threaded.  
	
	Feature Extraction:  There are quite a few feature points.  Thus comparing to the list from the single threaded execuation was how I did it.  

	Feature Classification:  Once again comparison to the single threaded

	Augmented Reality:  A red cube should be projected on the marker.  Turn on the window and check.

	Face Detection:  Typcally only 1 face although it can have 2 false alarms as well.

	Object Recognition:  Look at the output window.  Also the calculated transform or center point will help.

	Once again I will be adding automatic checking in the future.  But for now I have been using knowledge of the algorithms to check them
